# DLaaS - Datalayer as a Service
## Monetize Your Chia Blockchain Node

Welcome to the DLaaS repository, your one-stop solution for converting your Chia Blockchain node into a lucrative venture. This project focuses on the Chia data layer, offering its services to clients on a rental basis. The system operates as a Software as a Service (SaaS) product, facilitating secure interactions with your self-hosted Chia node, and delivering user-scoped blockchain services.

Built on Amazon Web Services (AWS), the infrastructure requires an AWS account for deployment. The repository utilizes Terraform as an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool for seamless service provisioning. Keep in mind that at the outset, running DLaaS without customers costs approximately $30 per month. As your customer base grows, expenses will increase, necessitating appropriately priced products to cover costs.

The SaaS product heavily depends on an RDS database to manage application state, an approach chosen to accelerate development and ensure a swift initial release. Future plans include phasing out the RDS dependency and shifting the service to operate solely on its dedicated data layer tables.

## Quick Start Guide

Follow these steps for swift setup and usage of the DLaaS system:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the DLaaS repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Create Terraform Cloud Account**: Sign up for a free account on [terraform.io](https://www.terraform.io/cloud/signup/account) and create a new workspace.

3. **Adjust Terraform Settings**: In the `main.tf` file of your forked repository, modify the "remote" settings to match your Terraform workspace. Also be sure to set your terraform version to 0.14.9 in the project settings.

4. **Modify Project Settings**: Update properties in `common/config.json` and `modules/service.subscriptions/products.json` to align with your project. Retaining default properties may result in deployment errors due to AWS resource conflicts.

5. **Define Terraform Variables**: Define the following variables in your Terraform workspace: `aws_access_key`, `aws_secret_key`, and `owner_email`.
> **Important:** There is a known bug in the javascript AWS SDK where slashes in the `aws_secret_key` dont excape correctly. Please try to generate a `aws_secret_key`
without slashes.

6. **Verify AWS Identity**: Upon the first deployment, AWS will email a verification request. Complete this promptly to prevent deployment delays.

7. **Set Up Nameservers**: Post-verification, you'll receive instructions for setting up your nameservers. Deployment cannot proceed until nameservers are configured with your DNS provider. If propagation causes a timeout, restart the deployment to continue from where it left off.

8. **Clone Repository**: Clone the forked repository onto a machine running a Chia Wallet (full node not required). Ensure datalayer settings are enabled on this machine.

9. **Set Up Worker**: In the worker folder create a .env file using .env.copy as a blueprint

10. **Find API Info**: A Swagger file is still in the works, while your waiting you 
can go to the API Gateway Console settings in AWS to view all the available API's.

11. **Setup uploader plugin on Chia Datalayer**: You need to modify your config.yaml to upload datalayer files to your cdn [Chia Datalayer Uploader Setup](./docs/setup-uploader-plugin.md)

Congratulations, you're all set to use the DLaaS system!

## Components
